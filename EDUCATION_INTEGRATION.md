```typescript
// Get most recent year for each school
const latestBySchool = new Map();
demographics.forEach(record => {
  if (!latestBySchool.has(school) || year > latestBySchool.get(school).year) {
    latestBySchool.set(school, record);
  }
});
```

### Yearly Trends
```typescript
// Aggregate by year
yearData[year] = {
  enrollment: sum of all schools,
  disabilities: sum of all students with disabilities,
  ell: sum of English language learners,
  poverty: sum of students in poverty,
  economicNeedIndex: average across schools
}
```
